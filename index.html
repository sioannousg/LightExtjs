                    <h3 class="sub-title">The leading European rating agency adds a third member to the Group Executive Board. Scope’s new CFO combines years of
                        capital market experience with a strong entrepreneurial spirit.</h3>
                    <div id="article">
                        <p>The Scope Group supervisory board has appointed Christopher Hoffmann (44) as CFO. His appointment to the newly created
                        role expands Scope Group’s Executive Board to three members. From 1 February, Christopher Hoffmann will be in charge
                        of finance, administration, IT and risk controlling for the entire group. The other two members of the executive
                        board are Florian Schoeller, founder and CEO, and Torsten Hinrichs, COO.</p>
                    <p>“With Christopher Hoffmann, Scope has gained a proven finance executive with years of experience in operations”, says
                        Dr Martha Boeckenfeld, Scope Group’s Supervisory Board chair. “Throughout his career, he has demonstrated the ability
                        to develop growth companies strategically and organisationally. His appointment as CFO further strengthens the development
                        and internationalisation of the Scope Group.”</p>
                    <p>Before joining Scope, Christopher Hoffmann was CFO of va-Q-tec AG, a fast-growing tech firm specialised in thermal logistics
                        and high-performance insulation. Together with the company’s founders, Hoffmann transformed the firm into a global
                        service provider to the pharma and biotech industry and successfully floated it on the Frankfurt stock exchange.</p>
                    <p>Prior to his tenure at va-Q-tec, he worked as a growth equity investor at the pan-European private equity firm Zouk Capital
                        in London. His career began at McKinsey & Company in Berlin and New York. After completing his studies in political
                        science and economics at the Free University of Berlin and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques (SciencesPo) in Paris,
                        Hoffmann graduated with an MBA from Columbia Business School in New York.</p>
                    <p>Hoffmann’s appointment is part of Scope’s organisational development, initiated last year to strengthen the structural
                        basis for accelerated growth in all markets. The group’s business lines are divided into four operating entities,
                        each with a distinct focus, led by managing directors with longstanding experience in their respective areas: Dr
                        Stefan Bund, who is managing director of Scope Ratings, alongside Torsten Hinrichs, and of service provider Scope
                        Risk Solutions. Dr Sven Janssen is the head of funds rating subsidiary Scope Analysis as well as of Scope Investor
                        Services together with Wolfgang Kubatzki.</p>
