                    <p>Scope Ratings has today assigned a first-time issuer rating of BBB to IBL Banca Spa (IBL), with a Stable Outlook.</p>
                    <p>According to Scope, IBL is a market leader in Italian cessione del quinto loans, an attractive niche product with high
                        margins and limited credit risk. While technically a consumer credit product, these loans are directly deducted from
                        payroll, partly secured against the employees’ termination fund, and are subject to borrowers being insured against
                        job loss and death. This product is specific to the Italian market, and Scope notes that IBL is the market leader,
                        with a share of ca. 15%.</p>
                    <p>The rating agency highlights IBL’s good financial fundamentals, especially in the context of the Italian banking sector.
                        Asset quality metrics are strong, with a non-performing loan ratio of 1.7% in 2016 and insignificant levels of loan
                        losses (8 bps in 2016). IBL has a good track record of profitability, with a return on assets of over 1% and a return
                        on equity of over 20% in 2017. Scope believes that IBL is well capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 11.6%.</p>
                    <p>IBL’s core business is funded primarily with deposits, but the bank also makes use of securitisation. The majority of
                        TLTRO funds will need to be repaid in 2018, and Scope expects IBL to fund itself more via securitisation.</p>
                    <p>The BBB rating also recognises IBL’s high exposure to Italian government bonds, which Scope considers a materially large
                        credit concentration (Scope rates the Italian sovereign at A-). The government bonds are primarily financed via repos</p>
                    <p>Regarding IBL’s ownership and governance, Scope notes that the bank remains held and controlled by its management. The
                        agency has a positive view of this situation with respect to business continuity and financial stability. At the
                        same time, Scope highlights the inherent key-man risk related to IBL’s CEO who has held this position since 1998.</p>
                    <p>Among potential positive rating change drivers, Scope mentions a material reduction in the carry trade on government
                        securities, as volatility in the value of governemnt bonds constitutes a potential negative rating change driver.
                        Scope also cautions that riskier diversification away from the current core business of cessione del quinto lending
                        could prove negative for the rating, as would a material increase in funding costs that could arise from substituting
                        central bank funding with private funding sources.</p>
                    <p>The following rating was assigned with Stable Outlook:</p>
